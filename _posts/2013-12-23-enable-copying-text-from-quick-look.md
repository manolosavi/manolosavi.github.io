Enable copying text from Quick Look

This is a very useful tip that will allow you to copy text from any Quick Look plug-in. Just enter the following commands on the Terminal:

```
defaults write com.apple.finder QLEnableTextSelection -bool TRUE
```

```
killall Finder
```

Hat tip toÂ [Craig Hockenberry](https://twitter.com/chockenberry/) for this one. And since we're talking about Quick Look and Craig already, you should check out his awesome plug-in to see provisioning profile's information:
